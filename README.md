Use a two-dimensional array to store a set of integers inserted as user inputs. Extract each integer r from the array and use it as an input parameter for a user-defined function coded to perform a required calculation. In this problem, the user-defined function should be tuned to calculate the area, perimeter of a circle considering r as the radius. Upon calculation, results will be stored in a text file in separate columnsâ€”the text file should have the following columns: a) Serial No. b) Radius, c) Area, d) Perimeter. Also, once you execute and run the program, it should print the two-dimensional array of radius and corresponding circle areas. Condition: Both the dimensions of the two dimensional array should be at least 5.
